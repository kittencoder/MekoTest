# Tables

Meko has the capability to draw tables in the terminal using different frames and rules.
eg. you can disable the headline row separator or even draw every data-line as a grid.

Colorisation in values is supported too.

Also you can supply different frame-presets or even your own.

Check the Tables.cpp for examples.

## Planned features

- support newlines within values
- support patterns in lines (eg. -~-~-~- as horizontal lines)
